# Set Up the Test Database Environment

### Provision the Database:

- se the Crunchy Postgres Operator to provision a PostgreSQL instance in the pre-created namespace in OpenShift.

```
bash deploy.pg.sh
```

### Configure the Database:

- Ensure the configuration, including resource allocations, storage, and replication settings, is as close as possible to production.

- Use PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims) to handle the storage needs, ensuring that sufficient storage is allocated to match the size of the production database.

## Replicate the Production Data Structure and Size

#### Schema Setup:

- Apply the same database schema (tables, indexes, constraints) from production to the test environment. we can extract this schema using tools like pg_dump:

```
pg_dump --schema-only -U <username> -h <production-host> <database> > schema.sql
```

- Load the schema into the test environment:

```
psql -U <username> -h <test-host> <database> < schema.sql
```

#### Generate and Load Data:
We can use to data generation tool like faker_fdw to generate data that mimics the production data size and structure.

## Validate and Optimize:

#### Validation
- Verify that the number of rows in each table matches the production count.
- Run basic queries to ensure relationships and data integrity are intact.

#### Optimize for Performance:
- Ensure the same indexes as in production are in place.
- Run VACUUM and ANALYZE to optimize query performance and update the statistics.

#### Automate this via data pipeline.
- Use github actions to setup and tear down the test database along with data ingestion.
